# Multi

> This project is still only a concept at the moment!

What if you could have:

- the benefit of distributed source control (scalable to as many repos as you want)
- fast and efficient local development
- optimized continuous integration

all without the pain of managing it yourself?

These are the goals of `multi`, a toolchain for orchestrating tasks across distributed workspaces.

## Status:

At the moment, this is just a concept, and still an early concept at that. We're still working to define the expected features and behaviors of what this tool could support.

If you'd like to follow along with that work, check out [the repo discussions](https://github.com/hamlim/multi/discussions)!
